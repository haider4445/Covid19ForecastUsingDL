Forecasting COVID-19 Trends in 2021: Comparing RNNs and Time-Series Transformers

Abstract:

There has been a lot of research work, effort, and publications related to COVID-19. 
After more than a year has passed, there is a lot of data available to analyze and predict what the future holds for us. 
In this project, we have used a large dataset that is constantly updated to predict the future trends of COVID 19 in the year 2021. 
We have focused mainly on the forecasting of the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and administrated vaccines in the chosen five states of the United States. 
We used a variety of different deep learning models to compare the results such as GRU, LSTM, and Time-Series Transformers for forecasting. 
In evaluation, we have also shown the efficacy of these deep learning models by comparing the results with baseline models such as Prophet models
and the SARIMA model. We used metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and R2 Score for the evaluation of these models. 
Out of all these models, Time-Series Transformers outperformed.
